Using the Metropolitain Museum of Art API: https://metmuseum.github.io/ 

This site's main focus is to allow users to browse a museum's collection by searching specific terms. 
A search returns one randos matching result, with the option to try again or go back and perform a new search. If a user is logged in, there is also an option to save. 
Users who create an account also have the option to save search results to their profile, along with the option to add notes about their thoughts and what it inspires them to create. Users are also able to save notes about future ideas on their own, with no associated search result. 
Users are only able to view their own saved results and notes--there is no option to view another users's page.

This utilizies Python/Flask, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Jinja, HTML, WTForms, Bcrypt, minmimal Javascript, and Bootstrap (bootswatch theme) for styling.
