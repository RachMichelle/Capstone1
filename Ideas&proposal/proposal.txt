Description/Goal:
Artist Inspiration Website–
This will be designed to help users find pieces within the collection of a museum, using their API. Users will be able to save favorites to their profile, and each entry under favorites will navigate towards a page with more information about the individual piece. Users will have the option to add their own notes via form about what the piece inspires them to create, and those notes will be added to the expanded information page for that piece.

Stack Focus: Primarily focused on back end with simple but clean front end UI. Will be using Python/Flask.

Type: Website.

Users: User demographic would be those with an interest in visual arts–this could be used by art students or established artists seeking inspiration. The search functionality will also be available without a profile for users to explore collections for enjoyment–profiles are only required to save favorites and notes. 

Data: Will gather information about each piece via museum API. All will be done via server-side requests so favorited pieces can be easily saved to the database.
